&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fear&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;
A word that can’t be aptly defined in any dictionary or book. It’s an emotion, an emotion powerful enough to blur logic and rational decision making. The one who has felt it, is the one who knows. Funny thing is, it’s a product of our own imaginations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Try remembering the things you were scared of as a kid. Things that terrified you. Think, and you will soon find that most of them were just imaginary. Personally, like most other small children, I was scared to death by ghosts and darkness. Now, I know darkness is absence of light or photons(yes, I took science). And as far as it about ghosts, now I know they aren’t real(OK, maybe they are).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fear is more like your first crush. You don’t know much about the person, yet you give them too much importance and respect in your head. Without knowing much, you end up thinking that they are your &lt;em&gt;“ideal partner”&lt;/em&gt;. They seem so genuine in your mind, they’re perfect.  &lt;br /&gt;
Now see fear from the same perspective. Without knowing exactly what it is, you make too big a deal of it in your mind. You make it the &lt;em&gt;“ideal thing”&lt;/em&gt; that can kill you or destroy you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember that mad stray dog? The dog that chased you, and you thought you were going to get bit? Well, that dog is fear. The moment you start running, it starts to chase you, but that’s the point! Running away was actually the reason you caused the dog to chase you. It’s a mistake we all make. Actually it’s more of a necessary step that confirms whether our fear is real or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your fears are genuine. You might be scared to lose some people. Imagining a life without them might be terrifying, but does it make fear a bad thing? No. It’s actually the most important instinct we humans ever had. It’s the fear of losing something that makes you realise how valuable the thing or the person is, and this realization gives you a reason to continue fighting for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t get me wrong. Some people want to &lt;em&gt;“eradicate fear”&lt;/em&gt; from their lives, which is actually a tremendously stupid idea.  &lt;br /&gt;
Imagine not being afraid of anything. You get a little frustrated over some issue, start getting suicidal thoughts and since you lack fear, you successfully attempt suicide! Now imagine another scenario where you come over your frustration and perform better next time. Sounds better, right?  &lt;br /&gt;
In simple words, fear prevents you from killing yourself and further pushes you to evolve. The only reason you are alive today is because your ancestors survived the harshness of the world, and they survived because fear kept them away from doing stupid things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But here’s a warning too: A lot of your fears are &lt;em&gt;“meaningless”&lt;/em&gt;. Fears, that are not actually yours, but have been incorporated in you through outside agents.  &lt;br /&gt;
There’s a line from poem &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.desiderata.com/desiderata.html&quot;&gt;Desiderata&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune.  &lt;br /&gt;
But do not distress yourself with dark imaginings.  &lt;br /&gt;
Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember, it’s absolutely fine to be scared, but being scared of &lt;em&gt;“meaningless”&lt;/em&gt; things? It’ll be a wastage of your precious energy and mental peace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember my english teacher, Mr. David once said in class, “या तो मौज में, या तो ख़ौफ़ में”(meaning you do something either out of fun, or fear). Fear is a force, and force can be used both for constructive and destructive purposes. These words from Jordan B. Peterson describes it perfectly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You want to get your fear behind you, where it’s pushing you forward, instead of in front of you, where it’s stopping you.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;div style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt; - Jordan B. Peterson &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watch this fantastic video in which Jordan B. Peterson explains how to get motivated by fear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/1W9bGi5Yc1c&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fears are part of life. Accept it. NEVER try to be &lt;em&gt;“less afraid”&lt;/em&gt;, instead try to be braver because you never get rid of your fears, you just learn to live above them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep going, never give up.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Devesh Anand</name></author><summary type="html">Illustration by Aaron Blanco</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/images/blog/fear.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4000/images/blog/fear.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Problems</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2020/05/03/problems.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Problems" /><published>2020-05-03T00:00:00+05:30</published><updated>2020-05-03T00:00:00+05:30</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2020/05/03/problems</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2020/05/03/problems.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blog/problem.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;problems&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Set&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;
A chapter in math. Its basically a bunch of similar objects, stacked together. Comedians have sets of jokes, a student have set of assignments and we all humans have sets(not set) of problems. It doesn’t really matter whether one is rich or poor, successful or struggling, old or young, there are problems in everyone’s life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poor people struggle to fulfill their daily needs. Once in a while they are forced by circumstances to skip a meal. They don’t have enough resources to afford proper education, shelter and even clothing. These are third world problems. Then on the other side of the spectrum, there are people who have everything. They have money, status and a freedom to have a lifestyle they want, and yet they have problems. They might have deteriorating health, relationship issues or they might be struggling with some bad habits. They might be drug addicts. They might have undealt psychological trauma. Basically these problems fall under the category of &lt;em&gt;‘first world problems’&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A grownup has to make sure they have enough money in bank account to pay the bills in upcoming month. That’s a problem for them. A kid, whose toy is broken also has a serious problem. A student with a deadline to submit an assignment has a problem. A &lt;em&gt;maggi-lover’s&lt;/em&gt; stock runs out, that’s a problem too. Point is, the world is a jar full of problems up to the very top.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Our world runs on hope.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Nonsense! Our world runs on problems. The economy doesn’t depend on cash flow, it depends on the constant flow of problems: unsolved ones incoming, solved ones outgoing. The amount of money a person makes is directly proportional to their problem-solving skills. Actually every skill you have, solves a problem. If it doesn’t, it’s not a skill, it’s a hobby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This might sound controversial: many great men are experts at ‘creating’ a problem, and then solving it to gain influence. And no, no reference to the current government scenario here(ok maybe a little). Current social media aren’t good enough, so have tik-tok. You already don’t look good enough, have fairness cream. You are not successful enough, watch my shitty motivational videos to be successful. And the biggest scam of this century, you’re not happy enough, go find happiness. This business of ‘problems’ is dark, destructive and unethical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being stubborn wont help. Or, being a egoist won’t help. 
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ego is the enemy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, an important stoic lesson that is evergreen. Your ego might tempt you, even fool you in thinking that either your simple problems are too big, or complex problems are too small to pay attention. You will face situations in life(for sure), when you’ll be in utter chaos. In those times, taking complete responsibility is the best option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don’t control your destiny, you control your choices. Now being a human, it’s natural to make choices that will make you fall in problems. The point I’m trying to make is, take responsibility. No matter how badly you believe that someone else is responsible, the truth is, at some point, it was your choice that led you to the point where you are right now. And remember, the first step to solve a problem is to accept that there is a problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world is full of shit, both in form of real shit and shitty people. I consciously never acknowledged it but maybe my subconscious mind knew it right from my childhood days. Maybe that’s why I have a principle- &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Keep things simple&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Before you go out thinking yourself a &lt;em&gt;‘messiah’&lt;/em&gt; who’ll solve the issues of world, first solve your own problems. I like how Jordan B. Peterson puts it, “Get your life together.” He has a simple rule: start by cleaning your room. If you can’t have your own life in order, then maybe the idea of going out and saving the world right now, is not a wise one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blaming &lt;em&gt;‘the system’&lt;/em&gt; won’t help. It’s a waste of time. &lt;em&gt;The system&lt;/em&gt; has already been built. It has been there since a long time. There were people before you(and will be in the future) with problems even bigger than your imagination, who made it to the very top going through the same &lt;em&gt;system&lt;/em&gt; you blame. So stop whining, and accept the problems you have. That’s half battle won. Then do rigorous, unbiased analysis of the issues, and I’m sure you’ll come up with solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep going, never give up.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Devesh Anand</name></author><summary type="html"></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/images/blog/problem.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4000/images/blog/problem.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">You are a slave</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2020/04/28/you-are-a-slave.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="You are a slave" /><published>2020-04-28T00:00:00+05:30</published><updated>2020-04-28T00:00:00+05:30</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2020/04/28/you-are-a-slave</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2020/04/28/you-are-a-slave.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blog/slave.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;slavery&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are a slave. You might be thinking what nonsense! It’s ok, that’s a normal human response to anything to which your belief system disagrees to.  &lt;br /&gt;
I clearly want to state I am not going to explore this topic from a symbolic(or existential) perspective, i.e, I wouldn’t be talking about the fact that we are slaves to time, God, or any other phenomena, that is not under our control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will explore the slavery you have put yourself into yourself. Knowingly or unknowingly, that’s another issue. Read the post completely, or simply don’t read at all. Half read post will do you more harm than good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re reading this in the 21st century, chances are you are already a victim of &lt;em&gt;‘&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/mind-change/201507/digital-dementia&quot;&gt;Digital Dementia&lt;/a&gt;’&lt;/em&gt;, in simple words, you are a slave to technology. Ever felt that you’re kind of lost and dizzy after a long session of screen time? Well, that is a clear symptom of dementia. And yes, I know there’s a difference between relying on something, and being a slave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, so it started like it starts every time. In America, British settlers came, the Red Indians didn’t pay much attention, and boom, the land was no more theirs. Something same happened in India. Britishers came for trade, and we welcomed them with open arms. Trade was beneficial for sure, but we failed to keep their actions and desires in check. Result? 200 years of slavery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The case with technology has been quite similar. Tech came in 1990s for the masses, suddenly erupted like wild fire in 2000s and was now a part of our lives. In this decade, we became heavily reliant on technology. Same mistake once again. We lost the track of when we became followers of technology, instead of it being the other way round. The time frame in which tech became mainstream is just too short, it is 15-20 years, and as expected, we humans couldn’t see the harmful impacts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When social media addiction first came under public attention, that was probably the first time the human society was alarmed. Then came an endless number of serious addictions associated with technology. Porn addiction, gaming addiction and now, addiction to video content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know what’s really interesting? Many people simply deny that they are addicted. They know they show every possible symptom, yet they fool themselves saying, ”Oh, I can keep down the phone whenever I want to!” Really? Then why is there such an unease when you can’t find your gadget near you for sometime? Why can’t you stay away from social media for a few days?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because you don’t want to. In better terms, your brain doesn’t allow you to. The need to secrete the feel good hormone surpasses logic and rational thinking. The thing about the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.healthline.com/health/dopamine-addiction&quot;&gt;‘feel good hormone’&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; dopamine is that it is the same hormone that makes a sane alcohol consumer alcoholic, a person (just )trying drugs a drug addict and a smoker, a chain smoker(not the band). Honestly, I personally struggle from the problem of addiction from time to time. The games! God they are just so mind blowing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a shocking news: Big corporations around the world are making billions of dollars out of your bad habit of addiction. The fact that you have become a slave to technology is the biggest reason why world’s top 5 corporations(with valuation over $600 billion each) are from tech industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s do some analysis about how is it harming you:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s affecting your mental health.&lt;/strong&gt; Addiction of any sort is directly correlated to increase in anxiety, stress and sleep issues.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You are lagging behind.&lt;/strong&gt; Your time is limited. 24 hours a day. That’s the time everyone has. You can either pursue your goals in that, or can waste it. Wasting too much time on things that aren’t helpful will naturally result into lesser time for necessary stuff, ultimately you lag behind.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It affects your relationships.&lt;/strong&gt; Whether it’s family, friends or your romantic partner. No one remains unaffected. You are a node in a huge network. If one node malfunctions, all nodes connected to it will naturally be affected.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It affects your physical health too. I don’t think I need to explain how.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, it will kill you before your normal expiry date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another slavery is something I’m dead sure you are a victim of. It’s food. Did you know that &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/aug/25/is-sugar-really-as-addictive-as-cocaine-scientists-row-over-effect-on-body-and-brain&quot;&gt;sugar can be more addictive than cocaine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;? Chances are, you didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a mind blowing fact. A person having a protein rich breakfast will have higher chances of being agreeable, even going as far as to accept an unfair offer presented to them. Sounds funny, right? But it’s serious. This is just one of the thousands of ways your mind, habits and ultimately life can be affected just by giving you a specific kind of diet, without any added drugs or chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m sure you might have read again and again that junk/fast food is bad for health, and like most people, your mindset would be that it causes obesity, cholesterol and heart diseases, basically ‘physical problems’, but these foods have a far serious impact on your mental health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They make you a junkie.&lt;/strong&gt; Your taste-buds give you a pleasing sensation when you eat something. Basically, your brain secretes &lt;em&gt;dopamine&lt;/em&gt;, which we discussed above.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They mess with your &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circadian_rhythm&quot;&gt;circadian rhythm&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They affect your productivity.&lt;/strong&gt; Unhealthy diet impacts your circadian rhythm negatively, thus affecting your productivity. How? Not going to explain. Go read &lt;em&gt;circadian rhythm&lt;/em&gt; through above link.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need to understand that your mind and body coexist. One’s health affects the other’s. Ever wondered why people suffering from depression become really thin(or fat)? Well, you know now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See, the thing is, you are a slave of your own desires(in a deep sense), and the reality is, you can get out of this slavery for sure, but it’ll be hard. Your brain will eventually trick you, deceive you or even force you to continue your unproductive(and bad) habits, but with proper strategy and persistence, you shall get over this problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a fantastic solution to your problem. To successfully deal with the problem, I advise you to take the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl-44jDYDJQ&quot;&gt;dopamine fast&lt;/a&gt;. The video from improvement pill describes the &lt;strong&gt;dopamine fast&lt;/strong&gt; in an outstanding manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep going, never give up.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Devesh Anand</name></author><summary type="html"></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/images/blog/slave.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4000/images/blog/slave.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry></feed>
