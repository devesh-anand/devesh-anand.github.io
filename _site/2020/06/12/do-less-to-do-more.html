            <p>Let me take you through the routine of our forefathers. Waking up early, cleaning their teeth, pooping, bathing, then having some breakfast with family and then finally going to work. Working the whole day and the coming back to the house. Having food, spending time talking to loved ones, doing some house chores and finally going to sleep. Once in a while they went to watch theatre, movie or puppet-show(depending on the era they lived in), which took place at a specific period of every month.</p>

<p>Now let’s talk about today’s life. Waking up, checking the phone, getting ready, sitting for breakfast, checking the phone(or watching tv), finding something interesting and adding it to your <em>“to do list”</em>. The list goes on and on and on…  <br />
One year forward, you look at the list and realise you hardly completed any tasks in it, but still you keep on adding more goals(and tasks) to it. You want to be a doctor(or engineer), writer, guitarist, gamer, activist and can’t afford to miss the upcoming series, because FOMO. Eventually you become overwhelmed with all the expectation you have with yourself. You realise you are nowhere near to achieving any of your goals. Honestly, this was inevitable. You can’t do everything, and this is one really important issue that is often neglected(and ignored).</p>

<p>The common(and deadly misconception) today is: <em>“More productivity means more work”</em>. Well the more one works, the more productive one will be, right? Wrong. It’s a trap. Productivity is about efficient work, not <em>“more”</em> work.</p>

<p>There an interesting psychology experiment that was carried out years ago(you should definitely try it on your friends and family too).  <br />
<em>(Below is an example)</em>  <br />
You suggest an person to have dinner together, and ask them,  <br />
“Which restaurant would you like to eat at?”  <br />
Now the interesting thing is, the person is likely to answer, “Wherever you say.”  <br />
Now let’s make some changes to the question,  <br />
“Which restaurant would you like to eat at? The one near the school, or the one at the shopping mall?”  <br />
Now there are really high chances that the person will make a choice between the given two choices. The point I tried to make was, more(or unlimited) number of choices are not a good option. When you have ten things to do in a day, chances are you will hardly do any of them, but instead if you had just three things to do, you would likely do atleast two of them(with maximum efficiency).</p>

<p>Unless you’re from a different world(or live in a cave), chances are you would’ve heard of Steve Jobs. Now here’s an interesting observation. If you check out any interview or keynote of Steve Jobs, you’ll see him wearing similar black shirt and blue jeans ever single time. No, he didn’t wear the same clothes again and again everyday, instead he had a wardrobe full of same clothes. He followed a principle called <em>“Standard Operating Procedures”</em>(SOP in short form). His point was, people waste time everyday choosing what to wear, and since his time was precious, he decided to fix this issue. Even Mark Zuckerberg was inspired by this and started wearing grey shirt everyday at work. The point is, they boiled down the number of choices they had to made.</p>

<p>In the first two paragraphs, I talked about the routine of our forefathers and the current generation. Our forefathers didn’t have much options to choose from. Even if they had, they would religiously boil down them to a few. Today, we have unlimited options to choose from. Zakir Khan puts it in a beautiful way in his podcast <a href="https://gaana.com/song/ep-11-winning-is-not-important" target="_blank">Umeed”</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“You need to choose your own battles”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Solution? Choose your <em>“own battles”</em></p>

<p>FOMO</p>
