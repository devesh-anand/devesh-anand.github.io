I"<p>“Every child is special”
A lie we are told(or fed slowly) right from our childhood.</p>

<p>This is what we have been telling kids right from the time they were toddlers. We want to increase their confidence, their self-esteem, so that they may perform well in their life, since more confidence leads to higher success rate. Nice strategy, should work fine, right? Wrong. Very wrong.</p>

<p>By the time these kids grow up, they have this idea of “every child being special” engraved in their mind. Of course they have confidence, but confidence backed by false perspective of the world. They believe(not think casually), that they are special. But when they move out into the real world, and face the ultimate suffering of humanity(life), their false sense of self-esteem and entitlement is shattered. They realise that the world is a big place, so big that it’s impossible to imagine the issues people are going through around the world.</p>

<p>Where some people are sad of the loss of their pet, some people are grieving over loss of a family member. Some are struggling to find a new job, whereas some are struggling to find food for one day. In simple words, people struggle, in ways you can’t even imagine. The sources of pain are uncountable, and even if you think you are special enough to have gone through the worst pains and miseries, trust me, there are numerous people like you, and you are not special.</p>

<p>We all want to make changes in the world. Bring revolutions. So do you. You are eager to change the <strong><em>“System”</em></strong>, but just can’t seem to work it out. You see hundreds of thousands of people, people like you, who are struggling for the same goal as yours. And then you face the truth the harsh way, harsh enough to crush your so called inflated “self-esteem”, that you, yes you, are not special. You never were. At least not if you were born in a middle or lower class family.</p>

<p>There’s a common notion these days, that millennials are hard to deal with. They are egoistic and all that nonsense</p>
