I"Ã<p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>This article can be seen as a review, summary or my understanding of the book, ‚Äú12 Rules For Life- An Antidote To Chaos‚Äù, written by one of the most influential figures of my life, University of Toronto professor and clinical psychologist, Jordan B. Peterson.</em></p>

<p>The book defines some rules, or morals, that we humans should abide by in life to live a meaningful life. The rules are not exactly rules, but a pathway to minimize suffering and misery in life, for the rules(and Peterson‚Äôs lectures) are based on the harsh truth of life: ‚ÄúLife is suffering‚Äù.</p>

<p>Peterson has been described as a curious and fascinating human by his colleague, Dr. Norman Doige in the foreword. In the world where we humans value our freedom so much, why would we like <strong><em>more</em></strong> rules in life? Because without rules, there‚Äôs no line, and when there‚Äôs no line, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"we quickly become slaves to our passions- and there's nothing freeing about that."</code> If we humans don‚Äôt take responsibility, our very own existence becomes a misery, because without responsibilities, there‚Äôs simply no meaning in life, and a life without meaning is more of a burden than a blessing.</p>

<p>Peterson was deeply affected by the underlying principles of World Wars and Cold war, which is proving superiority of ideology. The fact that more than 200 million lives were taken(and that too by their own leaders) in name of an <strong><em>identity</em></strong> was horrific. He has his house decorated with paintings of soviet revolution, not because he is a fan of Communism, but as a reminder of the genocide(s) in the name of utopia.</p>

<p>The idea of relativism, i.e, nothing is good or bad(or right or wrong), has been criticized. In words of Norman Doige reflecting hypocrisy of relativist, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"Scccccratccch the most clever postmodern-relativist professor's Mercedes with a key, and you will see how fast the mask of relativism(with its pretence that there can be neither right nor wrong) and the cloak of radical tolerance come off."</code></p>

<p>The philosophies underlying this book are derived from some of the greatest minds like Jung, Freud, Nietzsche, Solzhenitsyn, Dostoevsky, Eliade and Neumann. Although not directly, but philosophies like stoicism and utilitarianism are visible.</p>

<p>The idea of happiness being the primary goal of life is also contradicted. In Peterson‚Äôs words:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúIn a crisis, the inevitable suffering that life entails can rapidly make a mockery of the idea that happiness is the proper pursuit of the individual.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Talking about all the resentment in the world, the wars(in life as well as on the internet) in name of ideologies, he suggests the only hope for a better world, where conflicts based on <em>‚Äúideologies‚Äù</em> are minimum, is:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúIf we each live properly, we will collectively flourish.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Before I start with the rules, the foremost rule is that you must take responsibility for your own life.</p>

<p><em>To put it in simple words, the rule asks you to be more confident, striving to be better</em></p>

<p>The chapter starts with the analogy of hierarchy in lobsters and humans.</p>

<p>Peterson talks about hierarchies in detail, how they affect us, our confidence and our chances of future success. He explains why it is a bad idea to be at the lower part of dominance hierarchy.</p>

<p>Being in lower part of dominance hierarchy means lacking resources, power and ultimately confidence. When one is at the lower part of dominance hierarchy, the person is always subconsciously stressed. In their life, if one thing goes wrong, hell breaks loose.</p>

<p>In every crisis situation, be it local or global, the humans in lower part of dominance hierarchy pay the heaviest price. In a pandemic, it‚Äôs the poor who suffer the most. In economic crash, it‚Äôs the poor who lose the most jobs.</p>
