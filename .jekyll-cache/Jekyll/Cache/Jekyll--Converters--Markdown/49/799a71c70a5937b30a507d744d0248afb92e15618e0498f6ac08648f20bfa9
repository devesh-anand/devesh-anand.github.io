I"X<p>Set    A chapter in math. Its basically a bunch of similar objects, stacked together. Comedians have sets of jokes, a student have set of assignments and we all humans have sets(not set) of problems. It doesn’t really matter whether one is rich or poor, successful or struggling, old or young, there are problems in everyone’s life.</p>
