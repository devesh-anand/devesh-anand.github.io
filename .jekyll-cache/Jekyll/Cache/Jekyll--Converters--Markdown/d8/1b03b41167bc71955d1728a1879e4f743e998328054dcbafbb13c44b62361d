I"d<p>Every child is special. A lie we are told( or fed slowly) right from our childhood. This is what we have been telling kids right from the time they were toddlers. We want to increase their confidence, their self-esteem, so that they may perform well in their life, since more confidence leads to higher chances of success, right? Wrong. Very wrong.</p>
