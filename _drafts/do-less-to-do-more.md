Let me take you through the routine of our forefathers. Waking up early, cleaning their teeth, pooping, bathing, then having some breakfast with family and then finally going to work. Working the whole day and the coming back to the house. Having food, spending time talking to loved ones, doing some house chores and finally going to sleep. Once in a while they went to watch theatre, movie or puppet-show(depending on the era they lived in), which took place at a specific period of every month.

Now let's talk about today's life. Waking up, checking the phone, geeting ready, sitting for breakfast, checking the phone(or watching tv), finding something interesting and adding it to your *"to do list"*. The list goes on and on and on...    
One year forward, you look at the list and realise you hardly completed any tasks in it, but still you keep on adding more goals(and tasks) to it.
