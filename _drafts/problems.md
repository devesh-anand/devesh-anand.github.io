***Set***
A chapter in math. Its basically a bunch of similar objects, stacked together. Comedians have sets of jokes, a student have set of assignments and we all humans have sets(not set) of problems. It doesn't really matter whether one is rich or poor, successful or struggling, old or young, there are problems in everyone's life.

Poor people struggle to fulfill their daily needs. Once in a while they are forced by circumstances to skip a meal. These are third world problems. Then on the other side of the spectrum, there are people who have everything. They have money, status and a freedom to have a lifestyle they want, and yet they have problems. They might have deteriorating health, relationship issues or they might be struggling with some bad habits. They might be drug addicts. They might have undealt psychological trauma. Basically these problems fall under the category of *'first world problems'*.

A grownup has to make sure they have enough money in bank account to pay the bills in upcoming month. That's a problem for them. A kid, whose toy is broken also has a serious problem. A student with a deadline to submit an assignment has a problem. A *maggi-lover's* stock runs out, that's a problem too. Point is, the world is a jar full of problems(up to the very top).

***"Our world runs on hope."*** Nonsense! Our world runs on problems. The economy doesn't depend on cash flow, it depends on the constant flow of problems: unsolved ones incoming, solved ones outgoing. The amount of money a person makes is directly proportional to their problem-solving skills. Actually every skill you have, solves a problem. If it doesn't, it's not a skill, it's a hobby.

This might sound controversial: many great men are experts at 'creating' a problem, and then solving it to gain influence. And no, no reference to the current government scenario here(ok maybe a little). Current social media aren't good enough, so have tik-tok. You already don't look good enough, have fairness cream. You are not successful enough, watch my shitty motivational videos to be successful. And the biggest scam of this century, you're not happy enough, go find happiness. This business of 'problems' is dark, destructive and unethical.

The world is full of shit, both in form of real shit and shitty people. I consciously never acknowledged it but maybe my subconscious mind knew it right from my childhood days. Maybe that's why I have a principle- ***Keep things simple***. Before you go out thinking yourself a *'messiah'* who'll solve the issues of world, first solve your own problems. I like how Jordan B. Peterson puts it,"Get your life together." He has a simple rule: start by cleaning your room. If you can't have your own life in order, then maybe the idea of going out and saving the world right now, is not a wise one.
