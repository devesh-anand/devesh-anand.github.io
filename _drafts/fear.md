**Fear**
A word that can't be aptly defined in any dictionary or book. It's an emotion, an emotion powerful enough to blur logic and rational decision making. The one who has felt it, is the one who knows how it feels. Funny thing is, it's a product of our own imaginations.

Try remembering the things you were scared of as a kid. Things that terrified you. Think, and you will soon find that most of them were just imaginary. Personally, like most other small children, I was dead scared of ghosts and darkness. Now, I know darkness is absence of light or photons(yes, I took science). And as far as it about ghosts, now I know they aren't real(OK, maybe they are).

Fear is more like your first crush. You don't know much about the person, yet you give them too much importance and respect in your head. Without knowing much, you end up thinking that they are your *"ideal partner"*. In your mind, they're perfect.    
Now see fear from the same perspective. Without knowing exactly what the thing is, you make too big a deal of it in your mind. You make it the *"ideal thing"* that can kill you or destroy you.

Remember that mad stray dog? The dog that chased you, and you thought you were going to get bit? Well, that dog is fear. The moment you start running, it starts to chase you, but that's the point! Running away was actually the reason you caused the dog to chase you. It's a mistake we all make. Actually it's more of a necessary step that confirms whether our fear is real or not.

I remember my english teacher, Mr. David once said in class, "या तो मौज में, या तो ख़ौफ़ में"(meaning you do something either out of fun, or fear).

I'm at a point in life where my fears
