# Personal website

-  Made using Jekyll
-  Hosted on github pages, added domain <a href="https:deveshanand.com" target="_blank">deveshanand.com</a>
-  This site is also hosted on IPFS (Interplanetarty File System) or the decentralised web, and I have connected it to my blockchain domain <a href="https://deveshanand.nft/" target="_blank">deveshanand.nft</a>  
   **Note:** You will need a browser that supports decentralised domains (To access on chrome or Brave, download <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/unstoppable-extension/beelkklmblgdljamcmoffgfbdddfpnnl?hl=en" target="_blank">this</a> browser extension)  
   You can view the IPFS version of my site at <a href="https://ipfs.deveshanand.com" target="_blank">ipfs.deveshanand.com</a> directly without any hassle.
